        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a game developer currently working on several personal projects for my own use, and some for others.  <br>
        I have been practicing coding for a few years now and I am interested in learning more every day.  <br>
        I am good at Lua and Python, and I am working on learning Java, HTML, and C#.  <br>
        I'm also working on my art skills so I can create sprites and models for my projects.  <br>
        I like to help people as well, I even helped tutor people in Computer Illustration and Graphics and Math.  I wouldn't mind helping with coding as well.  <br>
        I like gaming, coding, and creating my own things.  The main project I'm currently working on right now is a mod for the game Windowkill (I recommend it, it's very well made).</p>
        <h3>Future Plans</h3>
        <p>I plan to get an education at college so I can get a good technological job, then I'll continue working on my own personal projects.  I simply love to create my own games and <br>
        play them.  I also plan on getting more on to the YouTube side and make either gameplay commentary or coding tutorials.  </p>
